# FBLA-Alexandra-Brandon-Jhonny-Mather-App

The app was created to help students, parents, and teachers to share their favorite moments, see recent events, explore different clubs, and send abscess.  The app in general is extremely easy to use, mainly because all the buttons have labels, and there’s labels for everything for the user not to be lost.  There’s a github and bug report function at the home screen for fixes.

Remember to be respectful when sending in forms for absences, pictures, and bug reports, and not just spam them.  Send school appropriate material, and please be on topic for the forms.

You can find the Github for the app with its files, please when using the app for any purpose to at least credit the makers.

This app has many uses to the Mather website and many online websites, while it’s possible to use the app without the internet, it’s not recommended.

The github link also has previous versions of the project so be careful, and download the one that says Mather. 

The app was made by an MIT app inventor and as such it doesn’t have any comments as the program doesn’t really let people program comments into it.  The program is very similar to many app builders as it lets the user drag and drop elements which is really good for people to see what they're making.  There is a ZIP for the source code if needed, and an APK.  There are however labels for all the elements of the program, and the aia file if you want to use it in your own MIT app inventor, you can.  There's also a folder of assets from the mather website and also stock pictures.
